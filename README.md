## Abstract

Addressing the escalating concern over hypertension prevalence and the recent decline in blood pressure control among US adults since 2013, this study, utilizing NHANES data from 2003 to 2020, investigates key factors influencing this trend. The retrospective analysis of 26,147 adults reveals age, medication usage, obesity/mobility, and immune system/personal health as significant contributors to blood pressure control decline. Notably, age's impact increased post-2013, echoing challenges in an aging population. Reduced medication usage, including issues of adherence and specific drug classes, underscores the need for interventions promoting medication adherence. Obesity, high BMI, and mobility-related factors, along with immune system indicators, were also linked to blood pressure control decline, emphasizing the importance of lifestyle and holistic health in hypertension management. The study's sophisticated analytical approaches provide comprehensive insights, informing evidence-based interventions to mitigate cardiovascular risks among US adults.
